### Press Release

**ATHENS, Ohio—August 5, 2014**—Nice Mohawk Limited today released the 2.0 edition of their flagship list-making application, Ita. The new release includes a complete modern redesign of the app and the addition of a new editing mode that allows for seamless in-line editing of multiple items. Ita is available on the iOS App Store for the incredibly low price $2.99, which in App Store pricing terms is considered to be somewhere between exhorbitant and unconscionable.

Ita 2.0 still features list syncing over iCloud; it now requires iOS 7.0 or later. Ita’s icon has been redesigned to use an atom symbol. “We thought really hard about how an atom could represent list making and couldn’t come up with anything,” related Bob Cantoni, a Nice Mohawk co-founder and serial kombucha taster. In addition to the new icon, Bob tells us that settings have been moved into the app itself for easier access. Gone is the feature where lists would, like a paper list, show signs of age as they were used, which confused a few customers who thought their phones were dirty and/or that Nice Mohawk was attempting to extort money from them. There’s still no Mac version of Ita but they say they're more prepared to make it than in the past. This release of Ita also adds a very nice editing feature—users simply tap on another list or item while editing and Ita switches to editing that item. In the past, to change which item you were editing, users had to mutter incantations while shaking their devices to a circadian rhythm. In addition to the new features Ita 2 also improves support for accessibility features and adds translations of the app into Traditional Chinese and Modern Greek.

“People love Ita because it lets you make lists and keep track of things,” said Benjamin Lachman, Nice Mohawk’s other co-founder and resident international football expert. “Ita 2.0 is even better as it lets you edit items faster, also it looks nicer. We kept Ita’s price high so that we can fulfill a lifelong dream of building a swimming pool filled with gold dubloons modeled after Scrooge McDuck’s money vault.”
