To celebrate the upcoming nerdery scheduled for June 10-14th somewhere near the [House of Shields](http://www.thehouseofshields.com), the folks over at [AgileBits](https://agilebits.com) are putting their products, which we [recently recommended](/blog/2013/05/the-problem-of-passwords), on sale for a whopping 50% off.

Seriously, if you didn’t purchase **1Password** due to it’s price tag before, you have half the reason to object to it that you did last week.
